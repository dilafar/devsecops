Basic Rule:

- macro: custom_macro
  condition: evt.type = execve and container.id != host

- list: blacklist_binaries
  items: [cat, grep, date]

- rule: The program "cat" is run in a container
  desc: an event will trigger every time you run cat in a container
  condition: custom_macro and proc.name in (blacklist_binaries)
  output: "cat was run inside a container (user=%user.name container=%container.name image=%container.image proc=%proc.cmdline)"
  priority: INFO  

UseCase Rule:

- macro: custom_macro
  condition: evt.type = execve and container.id != host

- list: blacklist_binaries
  items: [cat, grep, date]

- rule: The program "cat" is run in a container
  desc: an event will trigger every time you run cat in a container
  condition: custom_macro and proc.name in (blacklist_binaries)
  output: demo %evt.time %user.uid %proc.name
  priority: INFO
